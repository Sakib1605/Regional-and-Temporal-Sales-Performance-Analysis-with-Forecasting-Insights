-- Business Question:  Which regions are expected to see the highest demand growth for specific product categories next quarter?

-- This query forecasts the next quarterâ€™s demand growth for specific product categories across regions. 
-- Firstly, aggregating quarterly sales quantities by region and product category using historical data. 
-- The LAG function calculates the previous quarter's sales for each region and category.
-- The average growth rate is then calculated for each region and product category. 
-- Finally, the latest quarter's sales quantities are adjusted using these growth rates to project demand for the next quarter. 
-- The results are ranked by forecasted demand.
